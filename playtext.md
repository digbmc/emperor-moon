*EXCERPTS*

MOPSOPHIL: I was so sleepy last Night, I know nothing of the adventure for which you are kept so close a Prisoner to Day.

ELARIA: Cinthio came with Music last Night under my Window, which my Father hearing, sallied out with his Myrmidons! A clashing of Swords I heard, but what hurt was done, I know not.

MOPSOPHIL: See Madam where your trusty Roger comes. (*Enter SCARAMOUCH [^fn2] , with letters, peeping on all sides*) You may advance, and fear none but your Friends.

SCARAMOUCH: Away and keep the door.
